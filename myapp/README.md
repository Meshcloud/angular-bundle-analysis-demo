## Webpack Bundle Analyzer

Webpack Bundle Analyzer displays three different sizes. These are:
* **stat** This is the "input" size of your files, before any transformations like minification.
It is called "stat size" because it's obtained from Webpack's stats object.
* **parsed**
This is the "output" size of your files. If you're using a Webpack plugin such as Uglify, then this value will reflect the minified size of your code.
* **gzip** This is the size of running the parsed bundles/modules through gzip compression.
